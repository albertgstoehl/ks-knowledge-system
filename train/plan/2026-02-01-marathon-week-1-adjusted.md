# Marathon Training Week 1 - SCIENTIFIC ADJUSTMENT

**Date:** 2026-02-02 (Adjusted post-analysis)  
**Weeks to race:** 10  
**Week number:** 1 of 10  
**Analysis:** [Marathon Coaching Analysis](/docs/marathon-coaching-analysis-2026-02-02.md)

## 🚨 CRITICAL FINDINGS FROM DATA

| Metric | Your Value | Status | Target |
|--------|------------|--------|--------|
| **CTL (Fitness)** | 5 | 🔴 CRITICAL | ≥40 for marathon |
| **TSB (Fatigue)** | -19 | 🔴 CRITICAL | 0 to +15 |
| **ACWR** | 4.8% | 🔴 CRITICAL | 80-130% |
| **Tuesday Run HR** | 148 bpm | 🟠 HIGH | 120-135 for easy |
| **Deep Sleep** | 10.6% | 🟡 LOW | 15-20% |

**Bottom Line:** You're severely detrained (CTL=5) with accumulated fatigue. Marathon completion is at significant risk.

## 🧬 PHYSIOLOGICAL BOTTLENECKS IDENTIFIED

### 1. POOR RUNNING ECONOMY (Primary Limitation)
**Evidence:** 148 bpm at 8:39/km pace  
**What this means:** At this easy pace, a trained runner would see HR ~120-130 bpm. Your elevated HR reflects:
- Low mitochondrial density (detraining)
- Poor capillary development
- Inefficient oxygen utilization

**Solution:** Strict Z1-Z2 training only. Economy improves 10-20% with consistent base training.

### 2. NEGATIVE TSB (-19) - Fatigue State
**Evidence:** ATL (24) > CTL (5)  
**What this means:** You're in functional overreaching despite low fitness. Previous walk + daily stress not cleared.

**Solution:** 48-72 hours rest before next run. Prioritize sleep (target 9+ hours).

### 3. CRITICALLY LOW CHRONIC LOAD (ACWR 4.8%)
**Evidence:** 93% rest days over past month  
**What this means:** No training base to build from. Standard 10% weekly increases don't apply.

**Solution:** Frequency over duration. Better to do 5 runs of 30 min than 2 runs of 75 min.

## 📊 HEART RATE ZONES (Karvonen Method)

**Your zones (Age 23, est. max 192, resting ~50):**

| Zone | HR Range | Use |
|------|----------|-----|
| **Z1 Recovery** | 121-135 bpm | Easy days, recovery runs |
| **Z2 Aerobic** | 135-157 bpm | Base building, long runs |
| **Z3 Tempo** | 157-171 bpm | **AVOID - Grey zone** |
| **Z4 Threshold** | 171-181 bpm | Intervals (Week 5+) |
| **Z5 VO2max** | 181-192 bpm | Sprints (Week 6+) |

**Your Tuesday run:** 148 bpm = upper Z2 (technically OK but high for "easy")

---

## 📅 ADJUSTED WEEK 1 SCHEDULE

### TUESDAY - COMPLETED ✅
**Executed:** 6.01 km in 52 min, HR 148 avg, pace 8:39/km  
**Assessment:** Pace appropriate, HR slightly elevated. Training Effect 0.8 (low stimulus).

---

### WEDNESDAY - THURSDAY: RECOVERY PROTOCOL ⚠️

**CRITICAL:** Take 48-72 hours rest before running again.

**Decision Tree for Thursday:**
```
Thursday morning:
├── IF HRV > 53 (baseline): Run 5 km VERY EASY
├── IF HRV < 53: REST DAY
├── IF soreness > 3/10: REST DAY  
└── IF energy < 6/10: REST DAY
```

**If you run Thursday:**
| Parameter | Target |
|-----------|--------|
| Distance | 5 km (not 6) |
| Pace | 9:00-10:00/km (slower than Tuesday!) |
| Heart Rate | **120-135 bpm** (strict cap) |
| RPE | 3-4/10 |
| Strategy | Walk if HR exceeds 137 bpm |

---

### SUNDAY: LONG RUN - REDUCED ⚠️

**Original:** 12 km  
**Adjusted:** **10 km** (or split: 6 km AM + 4 km PM)

**Why reduced:**
- 12 km = 100% increase from 6 km (too aggressive)
- TSB = -19 indicates inadequate recovery capacity
- CTL = 5 means tissues not adapted to loading

**Targets:**
| Parameter | Target |
|-----------|--------|
| Distance | 10 km max |
| Pace | 8:30-9:30/km (slower than Tuesday!) |
| Heart Rate | 120-135 bpm |
| HR Cap | 137 bpm (walk if exceeded) |
| Strategy | Start at 9:30/km, negative split if feeling good |

**Mid-Run Check (at 5 km):**
- HR > 140? → Cut run short, walk home
- Feeling good? → Continue as planned
- Any pain? → Stop immediately

---

## 🎯 WEEK 1 SUCCESS CRITERIA (Revised)

- [ ] Complete Thursday 5 km at HR 120-135 bpm (or take rest if needed)
- [ ] Complete Sunday 10 km at HR 120-135 bpm
- [ ] Zero runs with avg HR > 140 bpm
- [ ] Sleep 8+ hours every night
- [ ] Morning HRV monitoring started
- [ ] No pain during or after runs
- [ ] TSB improves toward 0 (less negative)

---

## 🔬 TRAINING PHILOSOPHY: POLARIZED 80/20

**For next 4 weeks:**
- **80%** of runs: Z1-Z2 (HR < 137 bpm)
- **20%** of runs: Can include short strides/hills (Week 4+)
- **0%** in Z3 (tempo/grey zone) - avoid entirely

**Why no tempo (Z3):**
- Creates fatigue without adequate stimulus
- Less effective for aerobic development than Z2
- Less effective for anaerobic development than Z4-Z5
- Interferes with recovery

## 📈 10-WEEK CTL PROGRESSION TARGET

| Week | Target CTL | Weekly Mileage | Key Focus |
|------|------------|----------------|-----------|
| 1 | 5 → 8 | ~15 km | Recovery, establish pattern |
| 2 | 8 → 12 | ~25 km | Frequency over duration |
| 3 | 12 → 16 | ~35 km | Build consistency |
| 4 | 16 → 20 | ~40 km | Assess marathon feasibility |
| 5 | 20 → 24 | ~45 km | Introduce one workout |
| 6 | 24 → 28 | ~50 km | Build long run to 20 km |
| 7 | 28 → 32 | ~55 km | Peak volume |
| 8 | 32 → 35 | ~50 km | Maintain, sharpen |
| 9 | 35 → 38 | ~40 km | Taper begins |
| 10 | 38 → 40 | Race week | Marathon! |

**Reality check:** Week 4 assessment - if CTL < 15, strongly consider half-marathon instead.

---

## 🛌 RECOVERY PRIORITIES (This Week)

1. **Sleep 9+ hours/night** until TSB positive
2. **Morning HRV measurement** - track baseline
3. **Nutrition:** 5-7g carbs/kg/day for glycogen restoration
4. **Hydration:** Clear urine target
5. **No alcohol** - compromises sleep quality and recovery

---

## ⚠️ GOAL REASSESSMENT

**Honest assessment:** Marathon completion at significant risk.

| Option | Risk | Recommendation |
|--------|------|----------------|
| **Full Marathon** | 🔴 High | Aggressive build, target: finish not time, use run-walk |
| **Half-Marathon** | 🟡 Moderate | Much more achievable, positive experience likely |
| **Fall Marathon** | 🟢 Low | Build proper base over spring/summer, start CTL ≥ 30 |

**Decision point:** End of Week 4. If CTL < 15, switch to half-marathon.

## 🧠 HOW THIS PLAN WAS CREATED

This is not a generic "couch to marathon" plan. It was generated by:

1. **Pulling your actual data** from Runalyze API
2. **Analyzing physiological markers:**
   - CTL (fitness): 5 - severely detrained
   - TSB (fatigue): -19 - accumulated fatigue
   - ACWR (progression): 4.8% - no training base
   - HR response: 148 bpm at easy pace - poor economy

3. **Applying exercise science:**
   - Banister's TSB model for fatigue management
   - Gabbett's ACWR for injury prevention
   - Seiler's polarized training (80/20)
   - Karvonen HR zones for intensity control

4. **Adjusting based on YOUR bottlenecks:**
   - Low CTL → prioritize frequency over duration
   - Negative TSB → extended recovery before next run
   - Poor economy → strict Z1-Z2 only, no tempo
   - Low deep sleep → prioritize 9+ hours recovery

**Generic plans fail because they ignore individual physiology. This plan adapts to your data.**
