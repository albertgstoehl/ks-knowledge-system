# Upper-Body Hypertrophy + Running Maintenance

**Created:** 2026-01-14
**Goal:** Hypertrophy (upper body focus)
**Duration:** 6 weeks until review

## Rationale

- 3x/week running provides adequate lower body stimulus
- Heavy leg hypertrophy would interfere with running performance
- Upper body gets full hypertrophy volume (10-15 sets/muscle/week)
- Light leg maintenance (2-3 sets/week) preserves strength without excess mass

**Research basis:**
- Concurrent training interference is minimal at moderate running volumes
- Running doesn't build leg muscle (brief impact loading, insufficient time under tension)
- Some resistance training improves running economy and injury resilience

## Schedule

| Day | Focus | Duration |
|-----|-------|----------|
| Day A | Push | 75 min |
| Day B | Pull | 75 min |
| Day C | Upper Mix + Legs | 75 min |

**Running:** 3x/week on non-lifting days or morning of lifting days

## Day A - Push

| Exercise | Sets | Reps | RIR |
|----------|------|------|-----|
| Barbell bench press | 4 | 6-10 | 2-3 |
| Incline dumbbell press | 3 | 8-12 | 2 |
| Cable flyes | 3 | 12-15 | 1-2 |
| Lateral raises | 3 | 12-15 | 1-2 |
| Tricep pushdowns | 3 | 10-15 | 1-2 |

## Day B - Pull

| Exercise | Sets | Reps | RIR |
|----------|------|------|-----|
| Barbell rows | 4 | 6-10 | 2-3 |
| Lat pulldowns | 4 | 8-12 | 2 |
| Face pulls | 3 | 15-20 | 1-2 |
| Dumbbell rows | 3 | 10-12 | 2 |
| Bicep curls | 3 | 10-15 | 1-2 |

## Day C - Upper Mix + Legs

| Exercise | Sets | Reps | RIR |
|----------|------|------|-----|
| Overhead press | 3 | 6-10 | 2-3 |
| Chest-supported rows | 3 | 10-12 | 2 |
| Pec deck / cable crossover | 3 | 12-15 | 1-2 |
| Barbell squats | 2 | 8-10 | 2 |
| Romanian deadlifts | 2 | 10-12 | 2 |

## Volume Summary

| Muscle | Sets/Week |
|--------|-----------|
| Chest | 10 |
| Back | 14 |
| Shoulders | 9 |
| Biceps | 6 |
| Triceps | 6 |
| Quads | 2 |
| Hamstrings/Glutes | 2 |

## Progression

1. **Rep target:** Hit top of rep range with good form
2. **Add weight:** Increase 2.5kg (upper) or 5kg (lower) next session
3. **Reset:** If you miss bottom of rep range, stay at same weight
4. **RIR target:** 1-3 reps in reserve (avoid failure on compounds)

## Deload Protocol

Every 5-6 weeks OR when:
- Strength stalls for 2+ sessions
- Accumulated fatigue affects running
- Joint discomfort increases

**Deload week:** 50% volume (same weight, half the sets)

## Nutrition

| Target | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Calories | Maintenance + 200-300 |
| Protein | 135-165g/day (1.8-2.2g/kg) |
| Timing | Spread across 4-5 meals |

## Watch List

- [ ] Wrist comfort on barbell pressing (pushups avoided)
- [ ] Running recovery vs leg training balance
- [ ] Upper body fatigue accumulation
- [ ] Protein intake consistency

## Notes

- No pushups due to wrist issues (barbell pressing is fine)
- Leg work is maintenance only - running is the priority for lower body
- Adjust running intensity on Day C (leg day)
