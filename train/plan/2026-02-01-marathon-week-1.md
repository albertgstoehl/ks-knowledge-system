# Marathon Training Week 1

**Date:** 2026-02-01  
**Weeks to race:** 10  
**Week number:** 1 of 10

## Philosophy

Starting from zero with 10 weeks to race is aggressive. Priority order:
1. **Injury prevention** (one injury = race impossible)
2. **Consistency** (3 runs/week, never miss long run)
3. **Progression** (slow, sustainable increases only)

Ego is the enemy. This week is about establishing the habit, not building fitness.

## Week 1 Targets

| Metric | Target | Notes |
|--------|--------|-------|
| Total mileage | 11 km | Base building |
| Number of runs | 3 | Minimum for adaptation |
| Long run | 5 km | Sacred - must complete |
| Pace | Conversational | Can speak full sentences |

## Schedule

| Day | Run | Distance | Type | Focus |
|-----|-----|----------|------|-------|
| Tue | Easy | 3 km | Zone 1-2 | Just move, feel good |
| Thu | Easy | 3 km | Zone 1-2 | Same, build rhythm |
| Sun | **Long** | 5 km | Zone 1-2 | The non-negotiable run |
