# Marathon Training Week 1

**Date:** 2026-02-01  
**Weeks to race:** 10  
**Week number:** 1 of 10

## Philosophy

Starting from zero with 10 weeks to race is aggressive. Priority order:
1. **Injury prevention** (one injury = race impossible)
2. **Consistency** (3 runs/week, never miss long run)
3. **Progression** (slow, sustainable increases only)

Ego is the enemy. This week is about establishing the habit, not building fitness.

## Week 1 Targets

| Metric | Target | Notes |
|--------|--------|-------|
| Total mileage | 18 km | Base building (adjusted for capability) |
| Number of runs | 3 | Minimum for adaptation |
| Long run | 8 km | Sacred - must complete |
| Pace | Conversational | 130-145 bpm target |

## Schedule

| Day | Run | Distance | Where | Type | Target HR |
|-----|-----|----------|-------|------|-----------|
| Tue | Easy | 5 km | Treadmill ✓ | Zone 1-2 | 130-145 bpm |
| Thu | Easy | 5 km | Treadmill or outside | Zone 1-2 | 130-145 bpm |
| Sun | **Long** | 8 km | Outside preferred | Zone 1-2 | 130-140 bpm |

**HR zones (age 23, max ~197 bpm):**
- Conversational: 130-145 bpm (65-75% max)
- Should feel "too easy" - that's correct
- If you can't speak in full sentences, slow down

## Watch List

- [ ] Any knee/ankle pain (stop immediately)
- [ ] Shin splints (common in week 1-2)
- [ ] Energy levels (should feel easy)
- [ ] Watch HR - don't let ego push you to 160+

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Complete all 3 runs
- [ ] Long run done by Sunday evening
- [ ] No pain during or after runs
- [ ] All runs at conversational pace (HR check)
- [ ] Feel ready for Week 2

## Nutrition Notes

Not tracking yet - establish running habit first. General guidance:
- Hydrate before/after runs
- Protein within 2 hours post-run
- Sleep 7+ hours (sleep is training)

## Week 2 Preview

If Week 1 completed successfully:
- Total: ~20-21 km (+2-3 km)
- Long run: 10 km (+2 km)
- Same 3x/week structure
