# Marathon Training Week 1

**Date:** 2026-02-01  
**Weeks to race:** 10  
**Week number:** 1 of 10

## Philosophy

Recent base: ~10 km/week with mixed paces. Not starting from zero, but need to establish discipline.

Priority order:
1. **Injury prevention** (one injury = race impossible)
2. **Consistency** (3 runs/week, never miss long run)
3. **Pace discipline** (no more 160 bpm "now and then")

Ego is the enemy. The 160 bpm efforts stop now. Week 1-3 = all easy.

## Week 1 Targets

| Metric | Target | Notes |
|--------|--------|-------|
| Total mileage | 24 km | +14 km from recent base |
| Number of runs | 3 | Build structure |
| Long run | 12 km | First real long run |
| Pace | Conversational | 130-145 bpm ONLY |

## Schedule

| Day | Run | Distance | Where | Type | Target HR |
|-----|-----|----------|-------|------|-----------|
| Tue | Easy | 6 km | Treadmill ✓ | Zone 1-2 | 130-145 bpm |
| Thu | Easy | 6 km | Treadmill or outside | Zone 1-2 | 130-145 bpm |
| Sun | **Long** | 12 km | Outside preferred | Zone 1-2 | 130-140 bpm |

**HR zones (age 23, max ~197 bpm):**
- Conversational: 130-145 bpm (65-75% max)
- Should feel "too easy" - that's correct
- **160 bpm = NO.** That's tempo pace. Not this week.

## Pace Discipline

Recent habit: "now and then" 160 bpm efforts.

**Problem:** Unnecessary fatigue, injury risk, slows aerobic development.

**Fix:** All runs this week at conversational pace. Hard efforts come Week 4+.

**Watch alarm:** Set upper limit 150 bpm. Slow down if it beeps.

## Watch List

- [ ] Any knee/ankle pain (stop immediately)
- [ ] HR creeping to 150+ (slow down, walk if needed)
- [ ] Ego saying "this feels too easy" (good, that's the point)
- [ ] Energy levels (should feel easy, ready for next run)

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Complete all 3 runs
- [ ] Long run done by Sunday evening
- [ ] No HR > 150 bpm on any run
- [ ] No pain during or after runs
- [ ] Feel ready for Week 2

## Nutrition Notes

Increase carbs slightly for long run day:
- Pre-run: Light snack 1-2h before (banana, toast)
- During run: Water only (under 90 min, no fuel needed)
- Post-run: Protein + carbs within 30 min
- Sleep 7+ hours (sleep is training)

## Week 2 Preview

If Week 1 completed successfully:
- Total: ~26-28 km (+2-4 km)
- Long run: 14 km (+2 km)
- Same 3x/week, all easy
- First tempo effort Week 4
