# Marathon Training Week 1 - MONDAY UPDATE

**Date:** 2026-02-02 (Monday)  
**Weeks to race:** 10  
**Week number:** 1 of 10

---

## ✅ MONDAY RUN COMPLETED

**Today you ran:**
- Distance: 6.01 km
- Duration: 52 minutes
- Pace: 8:39/km
- Avg HR: 148 bpm
- Analysis: [Full Scientific Report](/docs/marathon-coaching-analysis-2026-02-02.md)

**Key finding:** HR 148 bpm at easy pace indicates poor running economy (detrained state). This is expected and will improve with consistent training.

## 📅 UPDATED SCHEDULE (Starting Monday)

| Day | Date | Run | Distance | Where | HR Target | Status |
|-----|------|-----|----------|-------|-----------|--------|
| **Mon** | Feb 2 | Easy | 6 km | Treadmill | 148 avg | ✅ DONE |
| **Wed** | Feb 4 | Easy/Rest | 5 km or rest | Treadmill | 120-135 bpm | ⏳ DECISION |
| **Fri** | Feb 6 | Easy | 5 km | Treadmill/outside | 120-135 bpm | 📋 PLANNED |
| **Sun** | Feb 8 | **Long** | 10 km | Outside preferred | 120-135 bpm | 📋 PLANNED |

**Total:** 21 km (adjusted spacing)

## ⏳ WEDNESDAY DECISION (48h Recovery)

**Check Wednesday morning:**
- [ ] HRV measurement (baseline ~53)
- [ ] Subjective energy (target ≥ 6/10)
- [ ] Any soreness/pain (target < 3/10)

**Decision tree:**
```
IF HRV ≥ 53 AND energy ≥ 6 AND soreness < 3:
    → Run 5 km VERY EASY (HR 120-135)
ELSE:
    → REST DAY (move run to Thursday)
```

**Why 48h rest:** TSB = -19 indicates fatigue. Muscle protein synthesis peaks at 48h post-exercise. Rushing next run compromises adaptation.

---

## 📋 FRIDAY RUN (If Wednesday was rest)

If you rested Wednesday:
| Parameter | Target |
|-----------|--------|
| Distance | 5 km |
| Pace | 9:00-10:00/km |
| Heart Rate | 120-135 bpm (strict) |
| Strategy | Walk if HR > 137 |

---

## 📋 SUNDAY LONG RUN

| Parameter | Target |
|-----------|--------|
| Distance | 10 km |
| Pace | 8:30-9:30/km (slower than Monday!) |
| Heart Rate | 120-135 bpm |
| Strategy | Start at 9:30/km, negative split if good |

**Mid-run check (5 km):**
- HR > 140? → Cut short, walk home
- Feeling good? → Continue
- Any pain? → Stop immediately

---

## 🎯 THIS WEEK'S GOALS

- [x] Monday 6 km completed (HR 148 - acceptable)
- [ ] Wednesday: 5 km at HR 120-135 OR rest
- [ ] Friday: 5 km at HR 120-135
- [ ] Sunday: 10 km at HR 120-135
- [ ] Zero runs with avg HR > 140
- [ ] Sleep 8+ hours every night
- [ ] Morning HRV tracking started

## 🧠 REMINDER: HOW THIS PLAN WORKS

This plan adapts to your physiology:
- **CTL = 5** (severely detrained) → Frequency over duration
- **TSB = -19** (fatigue) → 48h recovery between runs
- **HR 148 at easy pace** (poor economy) → Strict Z1-Z2 only
- **ACWR = 4.8%** (no base) → No tempo/threshold work

**Generic plans fail because they ignore individual data. This plan uses YOUR metrics.**

---

## 📚 SCIENTIFIC BASIS

- **Banister (1991):** TSB model - negative TSB = incomplete recovery
- **Gabbett (2016):** ACWR - low chronic load = high injury risk if ramped
- **Seiler (2010):** Polarized 80/20 - avoid Z3 grey zone
- **Mujika & Padilla (2000):** Detraining effects - economy improves with consistent Z2

---

## ⚠️ GOAL REASSESSMENT

**Marathon completion at significant risk** with current fitness (CTL=5).

**Decision point:** End of Week 4 (March 2)
- If CTL ≥ 15: Continue marathon plan
- If CTL < 15: Switch to half-marathon (more achievable)

**Alternative:** Fall marathon with proper base building

---

**Next Check-in:** Wednesday morning (HRV + subjective feel)
