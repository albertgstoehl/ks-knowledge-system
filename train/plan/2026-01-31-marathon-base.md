# Marathon Training - Week 1-2 (Base Building)

## Goal

First marathon completion. 10-week aggressive buildup starting from zero.
Philosophy: Consistency and injury prevention over everything.

## Week 1-2 Schedule

| Day | Activity | Distance | Pace | Notes |
|-----|----------|----------|------|-------|
| Tue | Run | 4km | Easy (6:30/km) | Establish habit |
| Thu | Run | 4km | Easy (6:30/km) | Keep conversational |
| Sat | Run | 5km | Easy (6:30/km) | Slight progression |

**Weekly total: 13km**

## Principles

1. **Run-walk is OK.** If you need to walk, walk. Marathon is about finishing.
2. **One cigarette matters.** Every day you don't smoke is better oxygen transport.
3. **Sleep is training.** 7+ hours or you're borrowing from next week.
4. **Pain vs soreness.** Soreness = muscles, diffuse, 24-48h. Pain = joints, sharp, persistent. Stop for pain.
5. **Long run is sacred.** Miss it = repeat week. No makeup miles.

## Watch List

- [ ] Knees (start conservative)
- [ ] Ankles (watch footing)
- [ ] Motivation (habit before intensity)

## Next 8 Weeks Preview

| Week | Mileage | Long Run | Focus |
|------|---------|----------|-------|
| 3-4 | 18-22km | 8-10km | Build base |
| 5-6 | 25-30km | 12-15km | Peak volume |
| 7 | 32-35km | 20-25km | Peak long run |
| 8-9 | 20-15km | 12-8km | Taper |
| 10 | RACE DAY | 42.2km | Finish upright |

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Week 1-2 completed without injury
- [ ] 3 runs per week established habit
- [ ] Ready to progress to Week 3
